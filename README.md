# Obsidian Flashcards LLM

This plugin allows you to automatically generate flashcards using Large Language Models (such as OpenAI's GPT*) from within Obsidian.

## Features
- OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` integration through official APIs. You can add you api-key under the plugin settings.
- Generate flashcards from any open note by running the `Generate Flashcards` command from the command palette. The generated flashcards will be appended to the current note, under a new markdown header.

**Note**: As of today, the plugin works with [obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) in mind, with the default formatting settings. The plugin will only generate inline flashcards with the format *Q::A*. Future updates will make this customizable through the settings.
